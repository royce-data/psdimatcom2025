# Workshop format

## Session Format

Each session comprises several talks on a common theme, there is no consistent number of talks per theme. The organising team identified some key themes across all talks, and assigned them to each session.

Following the talks in each session we introduce the [Quick-fire panel](#quick-fire-panel-format).

### Talk format

Each talk follows the convention of a conference format; a presentation followed by a shorter question and answer discussion between the speaker and the audience.

*Each talk is approximately 15 - 25 minutes long with 5 - 10 minutes of Q&A, up to 30 minutes for each slot.*

### Quick-fire panel format

During each session, participants are encouraged to submit general questions and comments regarding the respective theme of that session, in Google Document. Inpsiration can be drawn from the theme, general discussions during the workshop, the session talks, etc..
Following the final talk of each session, all session speakers will be asked, but not enforced, to participate in a panel discussion on the session theme and Google Document collated from the participants.

*10 - 15 minutes in length depending on number of speakers in each session.*

## Group discussion format

In advance of the workshop and during Day 1, participants are encouraged to vote on discussion topics on a prepared Miro board. 

During the group discussion, participants will be grouped, and assigned a discussion topic. All participants can collaborate on a Miro board of the topic.
