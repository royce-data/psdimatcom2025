The Physical Sciences Data Infrastructure (PSDI) provides access to diverse data sources, services, and tools, along with guidance and training for researchers and those who support them. The glue that joins these different resources together is the PSDI metadata. Here we describe how different metadata profiles, vocabularies, ontologies and standards enable PSDI services to describe the physical sciences resources and their contents and make them more searchable â€“ both currently and plans for the future.
