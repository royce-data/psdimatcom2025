We present MatFlow and HPCFlow, collectively referred to as MatFlow, ([GitHub Repo](https://github.com/hpcflow)), a workflow engine for running computational tasks locally and on high-performance computing (HPC) clusters.

We will discuss the capabilities of the MatFlow command-line interface, the MatFlow Python API, built-in task schemas which integrate Materials Science computational tools, future work, and use cases. 

*Stavrina and Aman will be delivering this talk on behalf of [Guy Bowker](https://github.com/Gbowker), Adam Plowman{{ orcid_icon(url="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9781-7353", class_smaller=true) }}, João Quinta da Fonseca{{ orcid_icon(url="https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6063-8135", class_smaller=true) }} and the [MatFlow](https://docs.matflow.io/stable/index.html) development team.*

*MatFlow was originally developed by Adam Plowman, supported by the EPSRC grant [EP/R001715/1](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=EP%2FR001715%2F1), LightForm, and is actively supported by researchers at the University of Manchester’s CLARI group and collaborators, and at UKAEA.
